            <h1>final project</h1>
            <p class="normaltext"> This assignment was completed on December 11, 2023 </p>

            <p class="normaltext">For my final, my explorative question was "how can I weave a cloth that can help ease sensory processing challenges?" My heuristic was that I would like to work with wire and create different touch surfaces.</p>
            <p class="blnormaltext">sample one</p>
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/1-1.png"> 
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/1-2.png"> 
            <p class="normaltext">For my first swatch, I wanted to create a sort of looping selvage that I would bead made of wire. I was inspired by the wire children’s toy where the child would move wooden blocks from one end of the wire to the other. I wanted to create a more refined adult version through cloth. </p>
            <p class="normaltext">My first key point was when I had to decide for the swatch what type of structure I wanted to use. I knew I wanted to experiment with structures to create my touch surfaces, but I wasn’t sure if the wire would mess with it, so I decided to go with a twill structure to start off. I chose this because it had more visual interest than tabby, but a basic stitch to start.</p>
            <p class="normaltext">The second key point was deciding how dense I wanted my swatch to be. I wanted there to be room to feel the wire, so I gave the swatch some room between fibers. I wanted the wire to clearly be there and incorporated into the swatch, which I did end up accomplishing through my decision to keep the swatch airy and open. </p>
            <p class="normaltext">My last key point was deciding how to end the wire segments. I knew that because the swatch was meant to be touched and handled in many ways (including being bent, turned, brushed, etc.) I wanted to make sure that no one poked or hurt themselves when handling the swatch. I decided to bend the wire in on itself so there wasn’t a way to snag or poke. </p>

            <p class="blnormaltext">- reflection -</p>
            <p class="normaltext">As a whole, the loom was not my favorite in comparison to the floor loom. I found the floor loom to be much more intuitive and fun to use, so I will try to work on there from now on. I would like to try the pocket again in the future as I think that two layer structures are really important to understand.</p>
