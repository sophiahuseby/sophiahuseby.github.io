            <h1>final project</h1>
            <p class="normaltext"> This assignment was completed on December 11, 2023 </p>

            <p class="normaltext">For my final, my explorative question was "how can I weave a cloth that can help ease sensory processing challenges?" My heuristic was that I would like to work with wire and create different touch surfaces.</p>
            <p class="blnormaltext">sample one</p>
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/1-1.png"> 
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/1-2.png"> 
            <p class="normaltext">For my first swatch, I wanted to create a sort of looping selvage that I would bead made of wire. I was inspired by the wire children’s toy where the child would move wooden blocks from one end of the wire to the other. I wanted to create a more refined adult version through cloth. </p>
            <p class="normaltext">My first key point was when I had to decide for the swatch what type of structure I wanted to use. I knew I wanted to experiment with structures to create my touch surfaces, but I wasn’t sure if the wire would mess with it, so I decided to go with a twill structure to start off. I chose this because it had more visual interest than tabby, but a basic stitch to start.</p>
            <p class="normaltext">The second key point was deciding how dense I wanted my swatch to be. I wanted there to be room to feel the wire, so I gave the swatch some room between fibers. I wanted the wire to clearly be there and incorporated into the swatch, which I did end up accomplishing through my decision to keep the swatch airy and open. </p>
            <p class="normaltext">My last key point was deciding how to end the wire segments. I knew that because the swatch was meant to be touched and handled in many ways (including being bent, turned, brushed, etc.) I wanted to make sure that no one poked or hurt themselves when handling the swatch. I decided to bend the wire in on itself so there wasn’t a way to snag or poke. </p>
            
            <p class="blnormaltext">- sample two -</p>
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/2-1.png"> 
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/2-2.png"> 
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/2-3.png"> 
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/2-dr.jpg"> 
            <p class="normaltext">For my second swatch, I wanted to iterate off of my first looping selvage, and move these loops into other places of my swatch to create a 3D effect. </p>
            <p class="normaltext">My first key point in my second swatch was deciding what type of color I wanted my weft yarn to be. I wanted the eye to be drawn to the looping wire that is coming out of the swatch, so I decided to go with plain white yarn because the alternating color warp was enough to give the cloth itself visual interest. </p>
            <p class="normaltext">The second key point was deciding how many loops of wire I wanted in the swatch. I knew that if I had too large of a loop, the structure of the wire would be much looser and I wanted it to be secure and not as movable. I decided to create multiple smaller loops so that there were plenty of places to move beads. </p>
            <p class="normaltext">My last key point was deciding what type of structure I wanted for my swatch. I knew that this structure was going to be used to secure looser wire into it, so I wanted a structure that would have as much surface area covered as possible. I decided to go with tabby in order to see if the structure was enough to hold the wire in place. </p>
            
            <p class="blnormaltext">- sample three -</p>
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/3-1.png"> 
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/3-2.png"> 
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/3-dr.png"> 
            <p class="normaltext">For my third swatch, I wanted to pause on the wire and start thinking more about the different textures and touch surfaces that I wanted to implement in my cloth. </p>
            <p class="normaltext">My first key point in my third swatch was deciding on what type of structure I wanted to use for my cloth. I knew I wanted one that would be satisfying to touch. I landed on a mixture of a basket twill, because I wanted it to have large blocks of yarn that would be interesting to touch and feel the dips and curves. </p>
            <p class="normaltext">The second key point was deciding if I wanted two different alternating weft colors or one solid color throughout the whole swatch. I was attached to both ideas, but I ended up deciding on two different weft colors. This was because not only did I want my swatch to be interesting texturally, I also wanted it to be interesting visually. Due to the fact that I did not incorporate wire into this swatch, I decided that two colors would not be too much.</p>
            <p class="normaltext">My last key point was deciding what extra visual interest I wanted in my swatch. I knew that twill/basket weave was interesting, but not interesting enough to warrant an entire swatch. I knew I wanted to do my own version to add a graphic element. I decided that I wanted to create a gradient of small stitch to large checkers back down to small stitch again. I wanted to recreate optical illusions that make things look curved, which I was extremely happy about how it looked in a cloth medium.</p>
            
            <p class="blnormaltext">- sample four -</p>
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/4-1.png"> 
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/4-2.png"> 
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/4-3.png">
            <p class="normaltext">For my last swatch, I wanted to use everything that I had learned from my past three swatches to created a cloth that I would recreate for my final swatch. </p>
            <p class="normaltext">My first key point in my third swatch was deciding what type of wire work that I wanted to use. I had tried looping beaded selvages as well as loops of wire as supplemental wefts that floated above the swatch. I loved both of those swatches, so I decided to incorporate both as one long weft that wove in and out of the cloth so that I could easily have both elements within the cloth.</p>
            <p class="normaltext">The second key point was deciding what type of structure I wanted to choose for the swatch. I knew that in my structure, I wanted enough surface area coverage so that it would anchor the wire in place, while also creating interesting touch surfaces. I decided on a twill-tabby switch. The tabby was good for creating an easy path to anchor the wire, while the twill created an interesting texture to touch on the back of the cloth. </p>
            <p class="normaltext">My last key point was deciding what colors I wanted to use for the cloth. I chose a pink wire that I thought was pretty, and so I wanted to use a contrasting color for the beads. I chose pink and white yarn for the final swatch so that the wire didn’t stand out too much, because I wanted the green beads to be a call to action almost. I want the contrasting color to prompt the use to touch and interact with the cloth. </p>
           
            <p class="blnormaltext">- reflection -</p>
            <p class="normaltext">As a whole, this was my favorite project that I have done this year. I have always really loved wire and wire craft/art, so I was super excited that I could incorporate it into my final for this class. Additionally, as someone who has to work with their neurodivergency and sensory processing disorders, I was excited to try to think about ways that textiles could be part of care and mental health. While my final was not perfect, I think that it is an amazing start and I would like to work on these ideas in the future. I would maybe make different color ways that are less muted, and I would also work on the 8S-2 loom for the future because I preferred the alternating color warp. Overall, I am really proud of my work, and I would love to continue working and implementing the skills that I learned in this class into my textile work in the future!</p>
