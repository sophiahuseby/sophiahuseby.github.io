            <h1>week ten: put it in a pocket</h1>
            <p class="normaltext"> This assignment was completed on October 30, 2023 </p>
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/pocket3.png">
            <p class="normaltext">My goal for this weekly assignment was to experiment with the 8S-2 loom in the ATLAS equipment room and try to learn two layer weaving structures.</p>
            <p class="blnormaltext">draft</p>
            <p class="normaltext">The draft that I used for the 8S-2 was the draft that was posted as an example. I did this because this was my first time weaving two layer structures, and I wanted to follow the example to get it down.</p>
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/pocket4.png"> 
            <p class="blnormaltext">set up</p>
            <p class="normaltext">When starting to set up, first soldered an LED with two wires and checked that they had a connection. When getting ready to weave, I found some tension issues due to pockets that had been made previously with conductive felt. I worked through this, but it definitely cause some issues.</p>
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/pocket3.png"> 
            <p class="blnormaltext">details</p>
            <p class="normaltext">I really enjoyed some of the sections close up on my swatch. I was really excited about the different twill sections, I thought it was really cool. I also loved that I picked weft threads that were about the same thickness as the warp because I enjoyed the lack of variation, which I think made the pattern easier to see.</p>
            <p class="blnormaltext">final swatch</p>
            <p class="normaltext">In the end of the 2 hours, I was surprised with how much I was able to weave. I was excited to see that I was able to fix a ripped warp, as well as troubleshoot other problems that I had not yet experienced. I am much more inspired for my final project, and I would like to draft a different pattern for the baby wolf floor loom in the future.</p>
            <p class="blnormaltext">reflection</p>
            <p class="normaltext">As a whole, the loom was not my favorite in comparison to the floor loom. I found the floor loom to be much more intuitive and fun to use, so I will try to work on there from now on. I would like to try the pocket again in the future as I think that two layer structures are really important to understand.</p>
