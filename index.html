        <h1>hello!</h1>
        <p>My name is Sophia Huseby (she/her) and I am a third year student working to obtain my B.S. in Creative Technology
            and Design. 
        </p>
        <p> I am extremely passionate about scenic and environmental design. In the future I hope to create sets/environments for film,
            theater or videogames. When I am not in school designing, you can find me spending quality time with loved ones, ice skating,
            or playing with my cat, Elliot. 
        </p>
        <p> My goals for ATLS 2200 Web are to learn and utilize skills in HTML and Javascript in order to create and maintain a 
            personal design portfolio in the form of a website that is customized to myself and my brand.
        </p>
