            <h1>week four: one-bit flipping bead</h1>
            <p class="normaltext"> This assignment was completed on October 1, 2023 </p>
            <p class="normaltext">My goal for this weekly assignment was to experiment with inlay and overshot weaving techniques, as well as different types of ways to implement the metal coils into the swatch. The materials I used in order to complete this assignment were my cricket loom, four different yarns, and metal thread.</p>

            <p class="blnormaltext">inlay</p>
            <p class="normaltext"></p>
            <img class="imageMargin" src="finalimg/inlay.png">

            <p class="blnormaltext">overshot</p>
            <p class="normaltext">The first technique that I tried on my first swatch was weaving with overshot. I was really happy with how overshot looked. I decided to do two rows of purple yarn following one pattern, and then broke it up with a white yarn following the reverse pattern. I think that this looked really cool, and overshot is definitely a type of weaving that I would like to use in the future to add visual interest into more of my projects.</p>

            <p class="blnormaltext">implementing coils</p>
            <p class="normaltext">The second technique that I wanted to try was twisting the statex conductive thread with white yarn. I thought that the thread was too thin to incorporate by itself into the weaving because it wouldn't show on it's own, so I tried twisting it with the white thread and I thought it looked really pretty. I decided this was the way that I wanted to weave it in. I thought it gave a subtle but pretty shine to otherwise plain white yarn.</p>
                   
            <p class="blnormaltext">final reflection</p>
            <p class="normaltext">Overall, I was really happy with how my first weaving turned out. I think that I had this expectation going into it that it would turn out perfect, which was not the case, but I am happy it didn't because now I know what to work on. In the future, I would like to work on neatening up my work, but also maintaining realistic expectations for my work. I would also like to attempt more challenging patterns and harder weaving as well.</p>
            <p class="normaltext">In terms of other things that I could make a loom out of, I think you could make a big loom on the surface of a table, poster board, etc.</p>
