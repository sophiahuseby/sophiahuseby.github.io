    <h1>Us (movie)</h1>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Us is a 2019 American horror film written and directed by Jordan Peele, starring Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, Elisabeth Moss, and Tim Heidecker. The film follows Adelaide Wilson (Nyong'o) and her family, who are attacked by a group of menacing doppelgängers.

        The project was announced in February 2018, and much of the cast joined in the following months. Peele produced the film alongside Jason Blum and Sean McKittrick (the trio previously having collaborated on Get Out and BlacKkKlansman), as well as Ian Cooper. Filming took place in California, mostly in Los Angeles, Pasadena and Santa Cruz, from July to October 2018.
        
        Us had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 8, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 22, 2019, by Universal Pictures. It was a critical and commercial success, grossing $255 million worldwide against a budget of $20 million, and received praise for Peele's screenplay and direction, Nyong'o's performance, and Michael Abels' musical score. </p>
    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <p>In 1986, a young girl named Adelaide watches a commercial for Hands Across America. At night, at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, she wanders away from her parents and enters a funhouse, where she encounters a doppelgänger of herself in the house of mirrors. Following the encounter she stops speaking and withdraws from her family.

        <p>Years later, an adult Adelaide goes on vacation with her husband, Gabriel "Gabe" Wilson, and their children Zora and Jason. She is apprehensive about the trip, but despite her misgivings, the family meet with their friends Josh and Kitty Tyler and their twin daughters at the beach. On the way there, they witness paramedics taking away the bloody body of an old man. Jason later sees someone strangely similar to the old man, standing still with his arms outstretched and hands bloody.</p>
        
        <p>That night, Adelaide tells Gabe about her childhood experience, but she is interrupted when a group of four people appear and break into the house. Cornering the Wilsons in their own living room, the group is revealed as their doppelgängers. They include Pluto (Jason's pyromaniac, mouth-scarred double), Umbrae (Zora's sadistic double), and Abraham (Gabe's animalistic double). They are led by Red (Adelaide's double), the only one who can speak, albeit in a guttural, raspy voice. Red explains that they are called "the Tethered” as they share a soul with their lookalike counterparts, and they have come to "untether" themselves. The Wilsons are separated and terrorized by their doppelgängers. Jason discovers that Pluto mirrors his actions. After Gabriel kills Abraham, the family escapes.</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile, the Tyler family is assaulted and murdered by their own doppelgängers at home. The Wilsons arrive and are assaulted as well, but they manage to overpower and kill the Tylers' doubles. They turn on the news and learn that the Tethered have been murdering their equivalents across the U.S., and after doing so, joining hands to form a massive human chain. The Wilsons decide to drive along the coast and escape to Mexico. While they are leaving, Umbrae attacks the car, and Zora kills her.</p>
        
        <p>Arriving at the boardwalk, the Wilsons find the townspeople already slaughtered. The road is blocked by a burning car. Jason realises it is a trap set by Pluto and orders everyone out of the car. Before Pluto can ignite the family's car, Jason moves so that when Pluto mirrors him he walks into the burning car. As Pluto dies, Red appears and snatches Jason. Adelaide chases after Red to the funhouse where they first met. She finds a secret entrance that leads to an underground facility overrun by white rabbits, and she finds Red in a classroom.</p>
        
        <p>Red tells Adelaide that "the Tethered" are actually genetic clones created by the government to control the originals on the surface. When the experiment failed, the Tethered were abandoned underground for generations, mindlessly mimicking the actions of their counterparts and surviving on rabbit meat. After they realized that Red was "different from the others,” she organized them to escape and take vengeance by murdering their counterparts. Red and Adelaide begin to fight, with Red evading and countering all of Adelaide's attacks. When Adelaide allows Red to attack, she impales Red with a fireplace poker, then strangles her to death and breaks her neck. She rescues Jason from a locker, and Jason also rescues one of the rabbits.</p>
        
        <p>While Adelaide drives the family away in the ambulance, she thinks back to the night she first met Red in the hall of mirrors. She remembers that the clone had choked Adelaide unconscious (damaging her larynx, making her voice raspy and guttural sounding), dragged her underground, handcuffed her there, and returned above ground to take Adelaide's place in her life, eventually learning to speak and adjusting to living as a human being; she is the Tethered clone, and Red was the real Adelaide. Jason looks at his mother, who merely smiles at him.</p>
        
        <p>The Tethered have formed a human chain, replicating the Hands Across America demonstration, stretching across the United States as helicopters hover overhead.</p>
