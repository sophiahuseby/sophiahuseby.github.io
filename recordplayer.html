            <h1>Final: Digital Record Player Using Arduino and Processing
            </h1>
            <p class="normaltext">Creators: Sophia Huseby, Ian Rowland, and Eric Wang</p>
            <p class="blnormaltext"> Overview:</p>
            <p class="normaltext">Our digital record player plays the instrumental arrangement of 4 songs (Canon in D, Industry Baby, Sweet Caroline, He’s a Pirate) in quintet form. The user can add or remove discs to control which instrument and their respective contrapuntal lines gets played. For these four songs, the record plays in a loop of 16 seconds of their starting musical sentence. The fifth song(I keep my beloved in a box) is continuous and is not affected by discs.</p>

            <p class="blnormaltext"> Inspiration:</p>
            <p class="normaltext">In our brainstorming session, one of our group members thought it might be interesting to do a digital record player. Another one of our group members, building on top of that idea, suggested that for the interactive portion, we could add and subtract voice lines. All of us love music and fell in love with that idea immediately.</p>
            
            <p class="blnormaltext"> Project Delegation:</p>
            <p class="normaltext">In our planning stage, we decided that Sophia will be mostly responsible for the box and other component manufacturing and design, Ian will be mostly responsible for electronics soldering, wiring and Arduino side coding, Eric will be mostly responsible for music writing/transcribing and processing side coding. With clearly divided responsibilities we each set off to our own research and work. Each of us had our successes in our assigned responsibilities, but we still helped each other out whenever anyone needed.</p>
            
            <p class="blnormaltext">Difficulties/Obstacles:</p>
            <p class="normaltext">Manufacturing: most of the manufacturing difficulties we encountered were logistical, as there are many different parts that needed different tools like a laser cutter and 3D printers, drills etc. Finding the appointments during the semester can be tricky. Some of the files at one point were corrupted and our progress was set back by that.</p>
            <p class="normaltext">Electronics: The main difficulty I encountered was soldering the individual neopixels to each other. I had to spend a lot of time on each one, measuring out each wire and assuring there were no shorts. Not shorting the LEDs was extra difficult because although neopixels are very small, each one requires 6 different solder joints, none of which can touch. Later on, it was difficult for me to stay organized while trying to wire and solder all of the pieces together. There were more wires than I expected and I had to stay engaged to assure that everything was being wired correctly.</p>
            <p class="normaltext">Programming: programming on the processing end has been smooth in terms of technical difficulties, however, we did have three different iterations of the code as we were improving our program. Coming up with ideas and testing them can be a lengthy process</p>
            <p class="normaltext">1. 1 st iteration: can only play the additional line at the starting period which occurs every 16 seconds. Programmer used the delay function for 16 seconds for the file to finish playing.</p>
            <p class="normaltext">2. 2 nd iteration: plays music on pretty much exactly the time the disk was inserted. How it works is music starts when detecting a change, programmer use cue function and millis function to pin point music location and play it. But there is significant delay with all the code process time and inputs delays etc. to the point where the downbeats dont match and was somewhat painful to listen to</p>
            <p class="normaltext">3. 3 rd iteration: it is the combination of the two previous iterations, it loops every 1 second and play files at the cue of the second marks. Theres the clicking sound of the file start and the legato is not smooth. But this version is the best as it has only a little bit of delay, it greatly increases intractability compare to the first iteration and mitigates the weakness of the second iteration.</p>
