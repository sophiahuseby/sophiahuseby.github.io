            </h1>
            <p class="blnormaltext"> Overview</p>
            <p class="normaltext"> In this four part lab, I created circuits using an LED, resistors, and a button to demonstrate comprehension of how to use arduino uno and arduino IDE. </p>
            <p class="normaltext"> The example arduino code that I used for this part can be viewed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gist.github.com/sophiahuseby/e423b37a7321c56034175f6cb62b9c45#file-atls-3300-lab-2-part-1-blink-code">here.</a></p>
            <p class="blnormaltext"> Materials</p>
            <p class="normaltext"> The materials that I used for this lab are an arduino (elegoo) uno R3 controller board, usb cable, usb adapter, button, 830 tie-points breadboard, breadboard jumper wires, resistors, LEDs, and a multimeter.</p>
            <p class="blnormaltext"> Part 1</p>
            <p class="normaltext"> The first step of the lab was to install the Aduino IDE to my computer. After this was accomplished, the goal was to connect the Arduino Uno board to my computer after grounding myself. I connected the board using a USB cable and USBC converter, and the green power light on the board turned on. This means that power from my computer was being supplied to the board. Next, I selected the Aduino Uno option in the board selection menu in the toolbar of the IDE. To test my Arduino Uno, I used the basic built-in example from the IDE by navigating File> Examples > 01. Basics > Blink. This code makes an orange LED on the board blink every second.</p>
            <p class="normaltext"> A video of this is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNx0AzCJ-Jc">here.</a></p>
            <p class="blnormaltext"> Part 2</p>
            <p class="normaltext"> In this second part of the lab, I needed to expand the circuit to blink an external LED using digital output. I created a basic circuit using two jumper wires, a 220 ohm resistor, and a LED (the circuit schematic can be found below). Then, in my code, I first set the LED_PIN to 10 (this is the digital output on the arduino board that I used). Then, within the setup function, I set the pinmode to be the LED_PIN as an OUTPUT (). This function is needed because we are outputting voltage from the Arduino to the LED. In the loop function, I made the LED turn on using the digitalWrite function and setting the output to HIGH (5V). Then, I created a delay of 1 second using the delay function. Next, still using digitalWrite I set the LED_PIN to low (0V) and then create another 1 second delay. When running, this code programs the arduino board to blink the LED at 1 second intervals. </p>

            <p class="normaltext"> For the second section of this part, I needed to change the interval at which the external LED blinked. I chose that it would blink at every half second instead of the original full second. I made this change by using the delay function and instead of having the variable it takes be 1000 (1 second), I changed it to 500 (half of a second). </p>

            <p class="blnormaltext"> Part 3</p>
            <p class="normaltext"> In this next part of the lab, I added to my circuit to add a button and another resistor (this circuit schematic can be found below). This resistor acts as a pull-down resistor which stops it from shorting. The digital pin 7 was connected to the ground through a 10k ohm resistor, but can also be connected to the 5V through the button. I had to add a digital input button switch to my circuit. By setting the button to be a digital input of the Arduino board, we can detect whether the pin has HIGH or LOW voltage. In order to set my button to be a digital input, I used pinMode(INPUT_PIN, INPUT) in the setup function, where INPUT_PIN is a global constant that is set as the pin on the arduino board that I am using to connect to the button. Using digitalRead function, I checked whether the pin has a HIGH or LOW state, and the return value is an integer (1 or 0). </p>

            <img class="imageMargin" src="img/PART3.png">
            <p class="normalText"> Using this new circuit that I created, I wanted to test the button functionality by creating a program that displayed a welcome message on the serial monitor every time the button was pressed. I did this by adding Serial.begin(9600) in the setup function, which implements the serial monitor so text can be portrayed on the screen. Next, in the loop function, I added Serial.println("Salutations, Earthlings"). Serial.println is used to have any text printed on the serial monitor. Proof of this working is shown below. </p>

            <p class="normaltext"> Next, I built on this code in order to test the status of the button. I created code to display "waiting..." when the button is not pressed, and a message saying "success" when the button is pressed. I did this by using while loops that were empty, and the only way to toggle between the two was the button press. I used the digitalRead function to assess whether or not the button was being pressed. I found this to be extremely effective without a delay. </p>

            <p class="normaltext"> Sometimes there is a button state that oscillates, even when I press the button once. The button is oscillating because of the manual aspect of the button can bounce up and down (bouncing), causing oscillation when unintended. A technique I could use to fix this would be debouncing. </p>
            <p class="blnormaltext"> Part 4</p>
            <p class="normaltext"> In the last part of this lab, I created an LED reaction game. The LED in the arduino turns on after a random interval, and the player pressed the button as soon as they see the LED light up. The output of the game is the time that the player took to press the button, which is their score. The game starts with a greeting, asks the player if they are ready, the LED turns on after a random interval between half a second to five seconds, and then once the button is pressed the LED turns off. </p>
            <p class="normaltext"> The functions I used for my code include the random function to create a random interval, millis function in order to measure the reaction time and time since LED turned on, etc. </p>
